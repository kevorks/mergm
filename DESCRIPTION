Description: mergm is used to fit ERGMs taking the node heterogeneity into account, 
    the estimation is carried out iteratively. For the estimation i.e. prediction of 
    nodal random effects, which counts for nodal heterogeneity, we use 
    pseudo-likelihood estimation techniques and for the estimation of networks 
    statistics, endogenous or exogenous, we use MCMC-MLE estimation techniques, 
    where the random effects are set as offset parameter.
